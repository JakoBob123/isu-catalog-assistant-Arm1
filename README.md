# ISU Campus Assistant

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prototype that answers questions about **Illinois State
University courses, billing, housing and dining**. Answers are grounded in the university's own
course catalog and websites, and every answer links back to the page it came from.

- **Corpus:** 4,842 active courses from the catalog's JSON API, plus pages crawled from the
  Student Accounts, Housing and Dining websites.
- **Retrieval:** BM25 keyword search and MiniLM vector search over a Chroma database, merged with
  reciprocal rank fusion.
- **Generation:** Google Gemini (free API key), told to answer only from the retrieved text.
- **Interface:** a Gradio chat app in ISU red and white, with source cards and starter questions.
- **Runs in:** Google Colab, top to bottom, no local setup.

---

## Quickstart

### First run

1. Open `notebooks/ISU-CampusAssistant-RAG-Demo.ipynb` in Google Colab (the badge above does this).
2. Get a free Gemini API key at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
3. In Colab, click the 🔑 **key icon** in the left sidebar → **Add new secret** → name it
   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, paste the key, and turn **Notebook access** on.
4. *Recommended:* in the configuration cell (§1), set `DRIVE_MODE = "mirror"` so the crawled data
   and vector database are saved to your Google Drive and survive a runtime reset.
5. In the crawler cell (§9), tick **`REFRESH_DATA`**.
6. **Runtime → Run all.**

The crawler fetches the catalog, crawls the three websites and builds the vector database. Expect
roughly 5–12 minutes the first time, most of it spent politely crawling. The assistant cell (§10)
then opens the chat app in the notebook and prints a public `gradio.live` link.

### Every run after that

Untick `REFRESH_DATA` and **Run all**. The crawler cell is skipped, and the assistant loads the
saved data in seconds without making a single catalog or website request.

### Refreshing the data

Tick `REFRESH_DATA` and run §9, or press **Check catalog for updates** inside the app. The crawler
compares fingerprints with the last run, reports what was added, updated or removed, and
re-embeds only the chunks that changed.

> **No API key?** The app still runs. It shows the closest matching courses and pages with their
> links, just without a written answer.

---

## How it works

The project is two programs that share one folder. The **crawler** is the only part that touches
the network for data; the **assistant** only reads what the crawler saved.

| Stage | What happens | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Collect (catalog)** | Pages through the catalog's Coursedog JSON API, 200 courses per request | `collect_catalog()`, `fetch_courses()` |
| **Collect (web)** | Crawls the billing, housing and dining sites, obeying `robots.txt` | `collect_website()`, `crawl_section()` |
| **Preprocess** | Strips HTML, navigation and footers; flattens course records | `clean()`, `to_record()`, `extract_page()` |
| **Chunk** | Courses stay whole; web pages are split into ~1,000-character overlapping chunks | `to_document()`, `split_text()`, `web_document()` |
| **Diff** | Fingerprints every chunk and compares against the last run | `fingerprint()`, `diff_documents()` |
| **Index** | Embeds new and changed chunks into Chroma; builds a BM25 keyword index | `CatalogIndex.build()` |
| **Save** | Writes the corpus, snapshot and vector DB to the cache folder | `save_snapshot()`, `mirror_to_drive()` |
| **Load** | The assistant's startup: reads the saved data, makes no requests | `CatalogApp.load()` |
| **Route** | Billing, housing or dining wording reserves half the slots for that section | `route_sections()` |
| **Retrieve** | BM25 and Chroma rank separately; rank fusion merges them; top 8 go forward | `CatalogIndex.search()` |
| **Augment** | Those 8 chunks are pasted into the prompt under a `CONTEXT` header | `Answerer.build_prompt()` |
| **Generate** | Gemini answers from that context only, linking the pages it used | `Answerer.answer_stream()` |
| **Publish** | Optionally pushes the corpus and vector DB to a Hugging Face dataset repo | `publish_to_hub()` |

---

## Is this actually RAG?

Yes. Retrieval, augmentation and generation are each one function. The question is scored against
every chunk and the top 8 come back (`search()`), those 8 are placed in the prompt
(`build_prompt()`), and Gemini writes the answer with an instruction to use nothing else
(`answer_stream()`).

Nothing is trained or fine-tuned. Gemini and MiniLM are used exactly as published, and everything
the system knows about ISU arrives in the prompt at question time. That is the case for RAG here:
course descriptions, tuition deadlines, room rates and meal plan prices change every term, and a
re-crawl updates the database in minutes where a fine-tuned model would be stale the day it
finished training.

## Data, chunking and the vector store

**Two chunking strategies, on purpose.**

- *Courses* are one chunk each. They are already short (median 481 characters, max 1,388) and
  self-contained, so splitting them would separate a prerequisite from its course code.
- *Web pages* are long and cover several topics, so each heading's text is split into
  ~1,000-character pieces on sentence boundaries, with 150 characters of overlap. Every chunk keeps
  its page title, heading, URL and the date it was fetched, so it can be cited on its own.

**Vector database: [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/).** A persistent client writes to
`isu_catalog_cache/chroma/`, one collection (`isu_courses`, cosine distance). Every record is
tagged with its `section` (`courses`, `billing`, `housing`, `dining`), so the dropdown and the router
filter inside the database. Every record also stores its fingerprint, so a refresh upserts only what
changed and deletes what disappeared.

**Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`: 384 dimensions, about 22.7 million
parameters, runs on Colab's CPU.

**Where the data is saved.** Colab wipes its disk when the runtime ends, so there are three options:

| Setting | Where the cache lives | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DRIVE_MODE = "off"` | Colab's local disk | Fastest; lost when the runtime resets |
| `DRIVE_MODE = "mirror"` | Built locally, copied to `MyDrive/isu_catalog_cache` | **Recommended.** Copied back automatically on a fresh runtime |
| `DRIVE_MODE = "direct"` | Directly on Google Drive | Works, but Chroma's SQLite file can hit "database is locked" on Drive |
| `publish_to_hub()` | A Hugging Face dataset repo | Set `HF_DATASET_REPO` and add an `HF_TOKEN` secret; `restore_from_hub()` pulls it back |

---

## When Gemini says it's busy

Free-tier Gemini models get overloaded at peak hours, and the free quota runs out. The app tells
these apart and handles each one differently, so a raw error never appears in the chat.

| Failure | Typical code | What the app does |
|---|---|---|
| Busy | 503 | Retries the same model after 1.5 s, 3 s and 6 s, then moves to the next model |
| Quota used up | 429 | Skips straight to the next model, since retrying only burns more quota |
| Rejected | 400 / 403 | Skips to the next model |

At startup, `rank_models()` builds a fallback chain of up to three models, one per tier (Flash,
Flash-Lite, Pro), because models in the same tier share capacity. `probe_models()` sends each one a
one-word test and drops any your key can't use. If every model fails, the chat shows the matching
sources with a one-line explanation. A partial answer that was already streaming is kept.

Still stuck? Run the **Troubleshooting Gemini** cell (`gemini_report()`). It tests each model and
prints `OK`, `BUSY`, `QUOTA` or `PERMANENT`. Setting `GEMINI_MODEL = "gemini-flash-lite-latest"` in
§1 is the usual fix for a Flash tier that is constantly busy.

## Crawling politely

- `robots.txt` is read for every host and obeyed.
- Each section stays on its own seed host, so a link to the university home page can't pull all
  of `www.illinoisstate.edu` into "billing".
- Each section has a page cap (120), a depth cap (3) and a half-second delay between requests.
- The crawler names itself in its `User-Agent` instead of pretending to be a browser.
- URLs with query strings, and non-HTML files, are skipped.
- Nothing behind a login is touched.

Before a full crawl, `check_sources()` fetches each starting page once and prints whether it
responded, whether `robots.txt` allows it and how much text came out. Thirty seconds there can save
a ten-minute crawl that collects nothing.

---

## Why there is a router

The catalog contributes 4,842 chunks and the three websites contribute a few hundred. In a single
ranking, a billing question can lose to course descriptions that happen to mention *cost* or
*payment*.

So when the dropdown is set to **Everything**, `route_sections()` looks for section words in the
question (tuition, refund, dorm, meal plan, and so on) and reserves half of the 8 slots for that
section. Matching is whole-word with an optional plural: plain substring matching finds "eat"
inside "weather", and strict word matching misses "meal plans". The dropdown can always be used to
search one section only.

---

## Accuracy and limits

- Dollar amounts, rates and deadlines must be quoted from the retrieved text, attributed to their
  page, and given with that page's "Last checked" date.
- **It cannot see anyone's account.** Balances, charges, housing assignments and meal swipes are
  behind a login. The assistant explains the process and links the right page instead.
- Answers are only as current as the last crawl. The status bar in the app shows when that was.
- There is no prerequisite graph; prerequisites are free text inside course descriptions.
- MiniLM reads at most 256 tokens, so the longest chunks are embedded from their opening portion.
  BM25 still indexes their full text.
- The catalog API is public but undocumented, and the websites are ordinary HTML pages. Either can
  change without notice.

**How it was checked.** During development every code cell was run offline against synthetic
courses, mock websites and stubbed Gemini and Hugging Face clients. That covered incremental
refreshes, the crawler's guards, section routing, the retry and fallback chain, and the
crawler/assistant split. Retrieval and answer quality on the real data are measured by the
experiments below, starting with Arm 1's 50-question labeled set.

---

## Experiments

### Arm 1: the assistant as built (baseline)

Arm 1 scores the system exactly as it is, so each later arm can change one thing and be compared against it.
It runs from **§13** of the notebook and asks 50 questions across course codes, course topics, billing,
housing, dining and trap questions with no answer in the data. Each question has a rule for what counts as
the right source, and every rule is checked against the loaded data before scoring.

| Measured | How |
|---|---|
| Retrieval | Hit@5 (in the visible source cards), Hit@8 (in Gemini's context) and MRR |
| Routing | Whether billing, housing and dining questions reach their own section |
| Answers | Whether Gemini answered, cited the expected course or site, and declined the traps |
| Correctness | Manual grades (correct / partial / wrong) in `results.csv` |

To run it, start the assistant, tick `RUN_ARM1` in §13 and run that section. The questions, results,
summary and a write-up draft are saved to [`experiments/arm1/`](experiments/arm1/); see that folder's
README for details.

---

## Configuration

Everything is set in the configuration cell (§1) and at the top of the crawl section (§3).

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `REFRESH_DATA` | unticked | Checkbox in §9. Tick it to run the crawler |
| `DRIVE_MODE` | `"off"` | `"mirror"` or `"direct"` saves the cache to Google Drive |
| `WEB_SOURCES` | billing, housing, dining | Which sites to crawl, and the section label each one gets |
| `CRAWL_MAX_PAGES` | 120 | Pages per section. Try 25 for a quick first run |
| `CRAWL_MAX_DEPTH` | 3 | How many links away from the starting page |
| `CRAWL_PAUSE` | 0.5 s | Delay between page requests |
| `CHUNK_CHARS` / `CHUNK_OVERLAP` | 1000 / 150 | Web chunk size and overlap |
| `TOP_K` | 8 | Chunks sent to the model with each question |
| `SHOW_SOURCES` | 5 | Source cards shown under an answer |
| `EMBED_MODEL` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Embedding model |
| `COLLECTION_NAME` | `isu_courses` | Chroma collection name |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | `None` | `None` picks automatically; set a name to pin one model |
| `PROBE_MODELS` | `True` | Test each model at startup and drop the ones that fail |
| `HF_DATASET_REPO` | `None` | Set to `username/repo-name` to publish to Hugging Face |
| `SHARE_LINK` | `True` | Print a public `gradio.live` link |

Two things to change before you crawl:

- Replace `your-email@ilstu.edu` in the two `User-Agent` strings (§2 and §3) with a contact address
  you are comfortable publishing. Site owners use it to reach you if the crawler causes trouble.
- To add a part of the university, add an entry to `WEB_SOURCES`, a label to `SECTION_CHOICES`, and
  a few keywords to `SECTION_HINTS` so the router can recognise questions about it.

## Running outside Colab

The notebook also runs in Jupyter on your own machine:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt notebook
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"     # Windows: set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key
jupyter notebook notebooks/ISU-CampusAssistant-RAG-Demo.ipynb
```

Leave `DRIVE_MODE = "off"`; the cache is written to `isu_catalog_cache/` next to the notebook.

The cache folder (`isu_catalog_cache/`) is deliberately not committed. It is rebuilt by the
crawler, and can be published to Hugging Face instead.
